# KalturaNg

The Kaltura NG project is a monorepo providing Kaltura Angular libraries for developing Angular projects:
* Unified theme
* Shared components build on top of [PrimeNG](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/)
* Shared classes and utilities such as Logger, parsers, uploader etc.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.0.

## Storybook

You can view all components styles, behaviour and documentation in the [Storybook project](https://kaltura.github.io/kaltura-ng/index.html)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
